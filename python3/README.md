#### Summary

This directory contains some examples of more common python3 programs.

#### Description

For some of these example I use tkinter for a UI so we get a useful program
on Windows without having to open up a command window.. It it not the most
intuitive toolkits but is standard on almost all installations. It works
and is fairly easy to code when you get used to it.


### tkmenu.py

This example is a canned example with a standard Menu with a File, Edit
and Help menu's. I only implemented a few functions but you get the gist.

### tkplot.py

This example shows a tkinter dialog with a simple plot. I just wanted
to show some way to display data. You will probably have to add matplot
lib using "pip". Another option is to draw directly on a python Frame. It
is not that hard.
