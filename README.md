#### examples

This directory contains a few example programs that I typicall
grab as templates for real work. This seems to be easier than
starting from scratch every time.



#### Git.

Since this is stored in a "git" repository, here are some quick notes about git. On
a linux machine you should just use the "git" command line program. Under Windows,
two decent options are either  1) downlaod "git for windows" or 2) use a gui such as
Tortoisegit.

### Git For Windows
Git for windows gives you a "bash" shell and you will need to know the command line
commands. It is best if you find a quick tutorial online. At the least you will need
to use the "git clone" command.

### Tortoisegit
Another option is to use a program called Tortoisegit. It can be found at:
http://tortoisegit.org . It integrates with the windows explorer command. You 
get context sensitive "Right Click" menues that allow you to run git commands.
